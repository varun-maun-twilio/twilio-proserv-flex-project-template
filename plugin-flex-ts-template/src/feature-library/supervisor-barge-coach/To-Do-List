// Summary Notes:
Another great day of coding!  We got the redux/props working properly along with a listener!  We needed to create a new standard action listern which was very straight forward.  We have another listener to register but that will be part of the advanced feature clean up.  Up next will be introducing the function into the code to get it to actually work!

What's Done:
-Work on merging Function code (and merged it from two functions to one :))
-Test simple barge/coach where redux update the icons properly (with a listerner!)
-We've registered Redux properly!
-Migrated state folder (with a few //FIXMEs, see below)
-Work on organzing Components
-Added Barge/Coach Features to Flex-hooks/components to add components in
-Add "Enable" feature flag logic for Supervisor Barge Coach
--Enabled Standard/Advanced toggled in flex-hooks/components to allow me to control features as I roll them out
--Required adding it to types/manager/ServiceConfiguration.ts & flex-config and all the dev - prod json files (setting those to true vs false)

Whats Next:
-Work on Sync
-Confirm refresh/cache clean up for button state is working properly
-Work on Coaching Panel, Supervisor Privacy Panel
-Update Package version to match Jared's latest updates



// Future Features
-Possibly enable/disable advanced features via feature flag (IE coaching panel, private panel, and supervisors monitoring panel)
--I've done this via the flex-hooks/components folder within the barge coach feature directory, but this may need to be moved, will consult with jared on that


DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
-Redux, oh redux...
    -You need to update ..\src\flex-hooks\states\index.ts with your custom redux/reducers
    -Mimic the .src\feature-library\xxxx\states\XXXX\directory
        -initialState (if applicable)
        -reducer.ts
        -types.ts
        -index.ts
        -actions.ts
-When Adding the components:
    -Update all the ui_attributes.jsons (dev - prod)
    -Add your component under .src\feature-library\xxxx\flex-hooks\components\xxxx.ts
    -Update the appropriate component within .src\flex-hooks\components\
        -This includes adding the import and updating the function to call it
-One roadblock was forgetting the connector in my container component file, I've fixed this but making a note for the future
-Functions
    -Need to get clarity on how best to leverage functions, should it start as a custom feature util and possibly migrate to a standard function util?
